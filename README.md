# Evil Hangman Game

Evil Hangman is a twist on the classic Hangman game. <br>
Unlike traditional Hangman, where the word to be guessed is chosen upfront, <br>
Evil Hangman changes the word dynamically to make it more challenging for the player to guess correctly. <br>
The program does this by choosing the word list that allows it to avoid selecting a specific word until it has no choice. <br>
